# Coin-Currency-Identification
Identify the currency to which each coin belongs to
A coin is a small, flat, (usually, depending on the country or value) round piece of metal or plastic used primarily as a medium of exchange or legal tender. They are standardized in weight, and produced in large quantities at a mint in order to facilitate trade. They are most often issued by a government. Coins often have images, numerals, or text on them. Obverse and its opposite, reverse, refer to the two flat faces of coins and medals. In this usage, obverse means the front face of the object and reverse means the back face. The obverse of a coin is commonly called heads because it often depicts the head of a prominent person, and the reverse tails. Coins are usually made of metal or an alloy, or sometimes of man-made materials. Coins made of valuable metal are stored in large quantities as bullion coins. They are usually disc shaped.

 

An agency associated with the IMF is trying to build a model that successfully classifies the coins according to their currencies. Your Task is to come up with a Deep Learning Algorithm that helps the users to successfully identify the currency to which each coin belongs to.
